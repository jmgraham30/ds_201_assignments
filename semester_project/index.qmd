## Overview

The semester project will incorporate all the components of a data analysis covered in the course throughout the semester applied to a data set of your choosing pending approval by the instructor. Various components of the project will be due at different times but you will have the opportunity to revise some components prior to the submission of the final product. 

A complete project, counting for 50% of the overall course grade will consist of the following:

- A data sheet describing the essential information about your chosen data set.  

- An initial exploratory data analysis for your chosen data set.  

- An appropriate analysis of your chosen data set with the goal to address a specific research question.  

- A project report developed using Quarto. You may view the rendered version of an example report [here](https://symphonious-crostata-5b1f0b.netlify.app/report/).

- Slides for a presentation summarizing your project. You will not actually present the slides. A rendered version of examples slides may be viewed [here](https://symphonious-crostata-5b1f0b.netlify.app/presentation/).

- A GitHub repository containing all code (appropriately documented) written and used in your project. An example project repository may be viewed [here](https://github.com/jmgraham30/baseball_weather/tree/main).

Your project report and presentation should be written as if it is addressed to a stake holder with some subject matter knowledge in the domain of application but not necessarily with a quantitative or programming background. 


## Project Component 1

The first component of the semester project is a draft of your data sheet. 

1. Begin by watching the video on Datasheets for Datasets:

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(magrittr)
vembedr::embed_youtube(id="R7s7_T4yXak",height=450) %>%
  vembedr::use_align("center")
```

The paper [Datasheets for Datasets](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3458723) lays out a framework for documenting data for data science projects [@gebru2021datasheets]. [View the paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3458723). We will follow this framework to create a data sheet for our semester project.

2. Obtain the raw data set or data sets for your semester project. 

3. Draft a datasheet that contains the following sections that address the specified questions:

- Section 1: Data Sources

Who created the data and where did you obtain it from? Why was the data collected? Is the data from a public or private source? From what population(s) has the data been sampled? 

Be sure that your datasheet includes links or references to the data source(s). 

- Section 2: Format of Data

What is the format of the original data? What type of files are used for saving or storing the data? 

- Section 3: Data Structure

What is the structure of the raw data? For example, is it tabular data? If so, how many rows and columns does it have? What information is in each column and row? Is the data self-contained or does it link to other sources?

- Section 4: Data Issues

Does the data contain any errors or missing values?

- Section 5: Data Cleaning

Has the data been cleaned in any way? If so, describe the cleaning process and what has been done? For example, where any missing values removed? Make sure to include files for the cleaned/processed data along with any code used to do so. 

- Section 6: Data Use

What is your intended use for the data? 


Your datasheet should be submitted together with all the relevant data files. 


## Project Component 2

The second component of the semester project is the results of your exploratory data analysis (EDA) for your chosen data set. This should include all the code you used to conduct an EDA together with a document that describes what you did and what you learned from the EDA.
